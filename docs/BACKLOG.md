# qrag — Known Issues & Backlog

This file is the authoritative backlog of known bugs, missing features, and optimization opportunities, derived from a full codebase audit. Items are ordered by criticality within each tier.

When starting a new session, review this file and prefer working on higher-severity items first unless the user directs otherwise. When an item is resolved, mark it with `[x]` and note the fix briefly.

---

## Critical — Broken or Data-Loss Risk

> **IS1–IS5 are user-declared top priorities**. Work on these before any other open item.

- [x] **IS1** `cli.py` — Rich TUI with three transient progress bars (Overall / Parse / Embed), adaptive rolling-average ETA, and a uv-style single-line summary on completion. Fixed in feat/is1-is2-rich-tui-report: `rich>=13.0` added to `[build]` extras; disabled when `--verbose`.

- [x] **IS2** `cli.py` — Post-build audit report. Fixed in feat/is1-is2-rich-tui-report: `build-report.txt` written to `~/.qrag/<version>/` on every build with SUMMARY, BY LANGUAGE, CODE FILES, DOC FILES, and SKIPPED FILES sections; per-file elapsed time measured in workers.

- [x] **IS3** `database.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `cli.py` — Only one active database at a time. Fixed in PR #16: `active_version` (str) → `active_versions` (list) with auto-migration; `qrag ai active [v1 v2 …]` replaces the list; all MCP tools fan-out across active DBs via ThreadPoolExecutor, merge by score, dedup. `config.py` gains `add_active_version()`, `code_db_paths()`, `docs_db_paths()`.

- [x] **IS4** `doc_parser.py`, `database.py` — Document chunks are missing critical metadata for LLM citation. Fixed in feat/is4-is5-rich-metadata: added `doc_name`, `doc_revision` (_REV_RE from filename), `doc_status` (keyword in filename), `word_count`, `fig_table_refs` to `DocSection` and `doc_sections` schema; `search_docs` now returns `source_path` + all new fields; `_open_docs()` auto-migrates existing DBs.

- [x] **IS5** `chunker.py`, `database.py` — Code chunks lack metadata the LLM needs for precise citation and navigation. Fixed in feat/is4-is5-rich-metadata: added `file_name`, `parent_name`, `call_depth`, `chunk_index` to `CodeChunk` and `code_chunks` schema; `visit()` now tracks depth+parent through AST; `_split_large_chunk` sets `chunk_index`; `search_code` returns all new fields; `_open_code()` auto-migrates existing DBs.

- [x] **C0** `chunker.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `database.py`, `cli.py` — Only C and C++ were supported. Fixed in PR #12: replaced individual `tree-sitter-c`/`tree-sitter-cpp` deps with `tree-sitter-language-pack` (305+ grammars); rewrote `chunker.py` with a `_EXT_REGISTRY`/`_FILENAME_REGISTRY`-driven rule engine; chunk_type is now language-agnostic (function/class/struct/interface/enum/macro/type_alias/module/constant); added `language` column to `code_chunks` and `symbols` with auto-migration; `_detect_input_type()` now derives extensions from the registry; build system files (CMakeLists.txt, Makefile, Cargo.toml, package.json, go.mod, pom.xml, conanfile.py, *.cmake, *.gradle, *.toml, etc.) are indexed as first-class code alongside source files.

- [x] **C1** `mcp_server.py:226-229` — All exceptions silently swallowed with `continue`. Fixed in PR #11: `JSONDecodeError` → `-32700` response + log; unhandled `Exception` → `-32603` response + full traceback logged to `~/.qrag/logs/mcp_errors.log`; `KeyboardInterrupt`/`SystemExit` → clean exit 0; fatal loop crash → log + exit 1.

- [x] **C2** `cli.py:543,547` — `db_path`/`ddb_path` can be `None` in code-only or docs-only `build` runs, causing a `TypeError` crash. Fixed: added `db_path and` / `ddb_path and` guards on all four checkpoint/drain flush calls in `_consume_and_embed`.

- [x] **C3** `database.py` (multiple functions) — DB connections opened without `try/finally`. Fixed: wrapped all 13 open/close call-sites in `try/finally db.close()` — covers `init_code_db`, `init_docs_db`, `delete_chunks_for_file`, `insert_code_chunk`, `get_symbol`, `list_symbols`, `load_manifest`, `upsert_manifest_row`, `delete_manifest_row`, `delete_sections_for_source`, `insert_doc_section`, `search_docs`, `search_code`.

## High — Likely User-Facing Failures

- [x] **GH#35** `pyproject.toml` — Default install downloads ~2.53 GB of CUDA libraries on Linux. Fixed by GH#38: torch+sentence-transformers removed entirely; onnxruntime (~30 MB) used instead. PR #39 superseded. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/35)

- [x] **GH#38** `embedder.py`, `pyproject.toml` — Replace sentence-transformers+torch with onnxruntime to eliminate CUDA baggage for all package managers (pip/pipx/uv). Reduces install from ~2.53 GB to ~30 MB for everyone. Fixed: onnxruntime+tokenizers; ONNX model from Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2; mean-pool+L2-norm in numpy; device/precision params kept for CLI compat. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/38)

- [x] **ISSUE-008** `embedder.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md` — GPU-accelerated embedding never actually worked: `resolve_device()` always returned `"cpu"` and raised on `"cuda"`; `onnxruntime-gpu` was never installable without a base-dependency conflict. Fixed: `resolve_device("auto"|"cuda")` now checks `onnxruntime.get_available_providers()` for `CUDAExecutionProvider`; `_load()` passes `["CUDAExecutionProvider", "CPUExecutionProvider"]` when device is cuda; `default_batch_size("cuda")` returns 1024 (was always 256); `onnxruntime` split out of base deps into `[cpu]`/`[gpu]` extras, `[full]` now aliases `[build,gpu]`; README documents per-OS (Linux/Windows/WSL) GPU prerequisites and a pre-flight verification command. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` AD-14. **Follow-up fix (AD-15):** real-machine testing found `[gpu]`'s original `<2.0` pin let the resolver pick `onnxruntime-gpu==1.27.0`, which silently requires CUDA 13 (`libcudart.so.13`) instead of CUDA 12 — every user following the documented CUDA 12 prerequisites hit an import error. Retightened to `onnxruntime-gpu[cuda,cudnn]>=1.21,<1.27`, added `ort.preload_dlls()` in `_load()`, and removed the system-wide CUDA Toolkit install steps from the README — the `[cuda,cudnn]` pip extras now provide the runtime directly; only the NVIDIA driver is required system-wide.

- [ ] **H0** `chunker.py`, `database.py` — Build-source relationship metadata: currently build system files (CMakeLists.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.) are indexed as isolated chunks. Phase 2 should enrich `code_chunks` with relational metadata — e.g. which source files belong to which cmake target/cargo bin/gradle task — so that RAG queries like "what files are compiled into the `my_app` executable?" return structured answers. Work: (1) add a `build_target` TEXT column to `code_chunks`; (2) parse cmake `add_executable`/`add_library` arguments to extract the source file list and back-link those source chunks to the target name; (3) do the same for Cargo `[[bin]]`→`src`, Gradle `sourceSets`, Maven `<module>` etc.; (4) expose `build_target` in `search_code` results so the AI agent can filter by target. Depends on C0.

- [ ] **H1** `database.py:249,378` — `feature_tags` stored as comma-CSV but split naively. Tags containing commas cause silent misalignment in search results.

- [ ] **H2** `database.py:350-422` — No validation that query embedding dimension matches `EMBEDDING_DIM=384`. A misconfigured model silently returns garbage search results.

- [x] **GH#23** `chunker.py` / `doc_parser.py` — Build fails with `'bytes' object is not an instance of 'str'` across `.js`, `.h`, `.c`, `.mk` files during the producer phase. Fixed in `pyproject.toml`: pinned `tree-sitter-language-pack<1.0.0` — v1.x (kreuzberg-dev "alef") changed `Parser.parse()` to require `str` not `bytes`; v0.x returns standard `tree_sitter.Parser` that accepts `bytes`. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/23)

- [ ] **H3** `cli.py:436-440` — Producer exceptions are caught and appended to an errors list, but `build` still exits with code `0` and reports success. A corrupted or incomplete database looks valid.

- [ ] **H4** `cli.py:525` — If a producer thread dies without emitting a sentinel, `queue.get()` busy-loops indefinitely. The `build` command hangs forever with no error.

- [ ] **H5** `chunker.py:50` — Sub-chunk names (`func#0`, `func#1`) can collide with real symbol names. `INSERT OR REPLACE` silently overwrites the correct symbol entry.

- [ ] **H6** `config.py:29-31` — Malformed `~/.qrag/config.json` raises an uncaught `JSONDecodeError`, breaking every qrag command until the file is manually deleted.

- [x] **GH#28** `cli.py:1247` — Incremental delta broken on interrupted build: `upsert_manifest_rows_batch` called only after full `_consume_and_embed` completes; any interruption loses all manifest progress → full re-process on next run. Fixed in fix/gh28-gh29-build-safety: boundary tracking (`_code_recv`/`_code_flushed`) writes manifest rows per-file immediately after each flush inside `_consume_and_embed`. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/28)

- [x] **GH#29** `cli.py:1065-1066` — `--force` silently deletes `code.db`/`docs.db` with no warning or confirmation prompt; users lose hours of build with a single flag. Fixed in fix/gh28-gh29-build-safety: shows DB summary (size, file count, last-built), requires `[y/N]` confirmation; `--yes`/`-y` skips for CI; non-TTY without `--yes` exits with error. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/29)

- [ ] **GH#40** `cli.py` — Ctrl+C during `qrag build` dumps worker tracebacks to the terminal and triggers an error log instead of shutting down gracefully. Should suppress pool tracebacks and exit cleanly. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/40)

- [ ] **GH#27** `cli.py` — Proportional CPU split: both `ProcessPoolExecutor` pools receive the same `limit_cpu`; dual builds over-subscribe cores → degraded throughput. Fix: split budget by file count ratio. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/27)

- [ ] **GH#30** `cli.py` — No pre-build visualization of existing DB (size, file count, last-built) or delta preview (N changed, M new); no confirm-before-proceed prompt. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/30)

- [x] **GH#31** `cli.py` — No resume-last-build: interrupted builds lose session state (input paths, device, progress); next run starts from scratch with no prompt to resume. Fixed in `feat/gh31-gh32-build-resume`: writes `<out-dir>/.qrag-build-state.json` after delta computation; detects it on next run with file count + %, shows resume prompt; `--no-resume` skips; non-TTY auto-resumes; state cleared on success and `--force`. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/31)

- [x] **GH#32** `cli.py:1077-1085` — "Roots differ" restriction blocks incremental addition of new `-i` directories; forces `--force` full wipe even though existing data is valid. Fixed in `feat/gh31-gh32-build-resume`: removed the fatal check for both code and docs manifests; dropped roots are warned and cleaned up incrementally; new roots are processed as new files via existing delta logic. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/32)

- [x] **GH#13** — Optimize Dependencies: Consumer vs. Builder Roles with Role-Based Installation. Split `pyproject.toml` into `dependencies` (consumer: click, sqlite-vec only) and `[project.optional-dependencies]` build/build.gpu/full groups; add `_ensure_builder_deps()` lazy-check in `build` command that detects GPU and prints actionable install instructions per package manager. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/13)

- [x] **GH#18** `cli.py:274-391,431-481` — Add Antigravity CLI support alongside Gemini and Claude. Fixed in feat/gh18-antigravity-support: detect `agy` binary; write MCP config to `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (global) or `.agents/mcp_config.json` (local) via new `_write_mcp_config()` helper; install skill to `~/.gemini/config/skills/qrag/SKILL.md` (global) or `.agents/skills/qrag/SKILL.md` (local). [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/18)

- [x] **H7** `cli.py:main()` — Restructured to never re-raise. `KeyboardInterrupt`/`Abort` → "Interrupted." + exit 130. `BaseException` → "Error: <message>" + exit 1. Raw tracebacks no longer reach the terminal; full trace still written to `~/.qrag/logs/`.

---

## Medium — Degraded UX or Performance

- [ ] **M1** `cli.py:466-499` — No progress reporting during embedding of large batches. The tool appears frozen on large codebases.

- [ ] **M2** `chunker.py:31`, `doc_parser.py:31` — Token count uses `str.split()`. Inaccurate for punctuation-heavy code; the 512-token chunk limit is effectively meaningless.

- [ ] **M3** `embedder.py:46-48` — Float16 precision loss on CUDA is not validated or warned. Search results silently differ between CPU and GPU runs.

- [ ] **M4** `cli.py:611-627` — When an input directory contains no supported files, the error message doesn't identify which `-i` path is the problem.

- [ ] **M5** `cli.py:658-718` — "Roots differ" error prevents incremental updates when adding a new source directory. Users must `--force` rebuild the entire database.

- [ ] **M6** `embedder.py:8` — Embedding model hardcoded with no version stored in the database schema. A future model change silently makes all existing databases incompatible.

- [x] **M7** `embedder.py`, `pyproject.toml` — Embedding model bundled inside the wheel via `scripts/download_model.py` + `[tool.setuptools.package-data]`. `_get_model()` loads from `src/qrag/models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/` and fails hard with a clear English message if missing. No HuggingFace call at runtime.

- [x] **M8** `tui.py:271-299` — Embed row's ETA column always showed `—` during `qrag build`. Root cause: `on_embed_batch()` recomputed the embed task's `total` on every batch from a jittery rolling estimate, and Rich's `Progress.update()` calls `task._reset()` (wiping the speed-sample history) whenever `total` changes — so `time_remaining` never had two samples to compute a speed from. Fixed by only updating `total` when the new estimate drifts >10% from the current value. See AD-16.

- [ ] **GH#53** `cli.py`, `embedder.py`, `tui.py` — Real-time live log file during `qrag build`: log records are currently buffered in memory and only flushed on failure, so a long embedding run gives no way to tail progress from another terminal/SSH session. Open an unbuffered `~/.qrag/logs/build-<timestamp>.log` at build start (plus a `build-latest.log` symlink), print the path, and log per-batch embedding progress. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/53)

- [ ] **GH#74** `explore.py` — Live-server integration tests for JFrog and git+LFS backends: currently only unit-tested at the command-construction level (`tests/test_remotes.py`), never exercised against a real Artifactory/git+LFS remote. Add opt-in tests behind `@pytest.mark.integration` covering the full push → list → download → delete round-trip. Follow-up from GH#44/GH#49. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/74)

## Low — Nice-to-Have

- [ ] **L8** `chunker.py` — Shebang/content sniffing for extensionless scripts (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env python`). Currently only extension and filename matching is used. Extensionless executable scripts in a project would be silently skipped.

- [ ] **L9** `cli.py:main()` — Clean user errors trigger the scary "Something went wrong / a log file has been saved / report this issue" banner. Any command that calls `sys.exit(1)` for an expected error (e.g. `explore stats <bogus>` → "version not found", `hub list` → "No repo URL configured") is treated by `main()`'s `SystemExit`/`BaseException` handlers as a crash worth logging. Should distinguish expected user errors (clean message, exit 1, no log/banner) from unexpected exceptions (log + banner) — e.g. raise a dedicated `UserError`/`click.ClickException` that `main()` prints without the report banner. Also tracked as **GH#75**. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/75)

- [ ] **GH#76** `explore.py` — Entry-point plugin discovery for `RemoteBackend`: the registry supports in-repo backends via `@register_backend`, but external pip-package plugins via `importlib.metadata.entry_points("qrag.remotes")` aren't wired up yet. Deferred item from the explore epic GH#49. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/76)

- [ ] **GH#54** `README.md` — WSL2 + CUDA workaround doc for uv-managed installs; superseded in practice by the onnxruntime migration (GH#38, resolved) but the issue itself (documenting the old torch/CUDA workaround) remains open. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/54)



- [ ] **L1** `cli.py:851-904` — No deduplication when a result appears in both code and docs search output.

- [ ] **L2** `cli.py` — No `--dry-run` mode for `build` to preview what would be indexed without building the database.

- [ ] **L3** `cli.py:936`, `database.py:376,417` — Snippets truncated without a `...` indicator; users don't know they're seeing partial content.

- [ ] **L4** `cli.py` — No single-file re-index; one changed file requires re-processing the entire directory.

- [ ] **L5** `github_distribution.py:253` — Checksum validation is skipped when the manifest download fails silently, allowing a corrupted database to be used.

- [ ] **L6** `cli.py:917,951,985` — Error messages reference `qrag mcp active` but the correct command is `qrag ai active`.

- [ ] **L7** `database.py` — No debug-level logging emitted under `--verbose` for database operations; makes slow or failing `build` runs hard to diagnose.

- [x] **GH#26** `cli.py`, `tui.py` — Rich TUI improvements:

## Feature — qrag explore (replaces hub)

> **GH#49 is the epic tracking issue.** Implement sub-issues in order #41 → #42 → #43 → #44 → #45 → #46 for vertical traceability. #47 and #48 are independent.

- [x] **GH#49** [EPIC] — `qrag explore` unified TUI + multi-remote database explorer. **Complete** — all sub-issues #41–#48 shipped across `feat/explore-*` (PRs #66, #67, #68, #69, #70, #71, #72, + push-all). `explore` now provides `list`/`stats`/`download`/`delete`/`push`/`diff`, an interactive `TreeView` browser + diff, a `RemoteBackend` ABC + registry with GitHub/HuggingFace/JFrog/git+LFS backends, a `remotes{}` config with `add`/`remove`/`list`/`set-remote`, and `push --all-remotes`. Note: unlike the original AD-10 plan, `qrag hub` was **retained** (explore wraps `github_distribution.py`) rather than deprecated. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` AD-10. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/49)
- [x] **GH#41** [EXPLORE-A] `explore.py`, `cli.py` — MVP: `qrag explore list` (local database table) + `qrag explore stats <version>`. Fixed in `feat/explore-list-stats`: new pure read-only data layer `src/qrag/explore.py` (`gather_local_versions`, `compute_stats`, `lang_percentages`, `human_size`, `human_age`) reads `~/.qrag/<version>/{code.db,docs.db}` without loading sqlite-vec; `cli.py` renders a Rich table (plain-text fallback when `rich` absent). Scope decision from the design grilling: **lean stats panel** (language %, symbol/section/doc/word counts, size, build date via newest DB mtime, active flag) — the keyword tag cloud and file-manifest "coverage" from the original ticket were **dropped**. Local-only; the `RemoteBackend` ABC and `remotes{}` config arrive in EXPLORE-B (#42). Tests in `tests/test_explore.py` (11). [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/41)
- [x] **GH#42** [EXPLORE-B] `explore.py`, `config.py`, `github_distribution.py`, `cli.py` — GitHub remote integration. Fixed in `feat/explore-github-remote`: added the **extensible remote layer** — `RemoteBackend` ABC + `@register_backend("type")` registry + `GitHubBackend` wrapping `github_distribution.py` (new `fetch_releases`/`delete_release`/`_repo_path` helpers; DRY'd the 3 inline repo-path parses). `config.py` gains a `remotes{}` registry with legacy `repo_url`→`remotes["default"]` auto-migration and `get_remote`/`default_remote`/`add_remote`/`remove_remote` helpers. `explore list --remote [NAME]` merges local+remote by name (Location column: local / remote / local+remote), degrading gracefully with a warning if the remote is unreachable; `explore download VERSION --remote [NAME]` fetches, writes `origin_remote`/`origin_version` into the per-version `config.json`, and activates. `push`/`delete_remote` are implemented on the backend (CLI surfaced in #45). Tests in `tests/test_remotes.py` (16). [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/42)
- [x] **GH#43** [EXPLORE-C] `explore.py`, `config.py`, `cli.py` — `qrag explore delete <version>`. Fixed in `feat/explore-delete`: shows a summary (content · size · build age), prompts `[y/N]` with `--yes`/`-y` to skip, refuses without `--yes` in a non-interactive shell (mirrors the build `--force` guard), and auto-deactivates. New `explore.delete_local()` (rmtree + deactivate) and `config.remove_active_version()`. Tests in `tests/test_explore.py`. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/43)
- [x] **GH#44** [EXPLORE-D] `explore.py`, `cli.py` — Additional remote backends + registry management. Fixed in `feat/explore-backends-remotes`: three new `@register_backend` classes — `HFBackend` (HuggingFace Hub via the already-present `huggingface_hub` SDK; a "version" is a top-level folder in a dataset repo; `HF_TOKEN`/`huggingface-cli`), `JFrogBackend` (Artifactory via the `jf` CLI; `jf rt search`/`download`/`upload`/`delete`), `GitLFSBackend` (git repo of per-version folders, `*.db` tracked via git-lfs, operated through a throwaway shallow clone). Each lazily detects its tool and raises an actionable error only when used — **no new required deps**. CLI: `explore add-remote NAME --type TYPE URL` (validates type against the registry), `remove-remote`, `list-remotes`, `set-remote VERSION REMOTE`. Tests in `tests/test_remotes.py` (mocked SDK/CLI). **Live-test status:** HF is unit-tested against a mocked SDK; JFrog and git+LFS are unit-tested at the command-construction level but not yet exercised against live servers (per the plan, real-remote coverage sits behind `@pytest.mark.integration`). [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/44)
- [x] **GH#45** [EXPLORE-E] `explore.py`, `cli.py` — `qrag explore push <version>` + protected remote delete. Fixed in `feat/explore-push`: `explore push VERSION --remote [NAME] --dry-run --force` resolves the target as explicit remote → the version's `origin_remote` → the default (`resolve_push_backend`, which also rejects read-only backends via `can_push`); `--dry-run` lists the asset files without uploading; a `check_auth()` pre-flight runs before the real push. `explore delete VERSION --remote NAME` is the **protected** remote wipe — it warns it removes the release for the whole team and requires typing the version name to confirm (or `--yes`; non-TTY without `--yes` is refused). `set-remote` shipped in #44. Tests in `tests/test_remotes.py`. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/45)
- [x] **GH#46** [EXPLORE-F] `tui.py`, `cli.py`, `pyproject.toml` — `qrag explore` (no args): interactive browser. Fixed in `feat/explore-tui`: reusable **`TreeView`** widget (expand/collapse, subsequence fuzzy filter with ancestor-keeping + auto-expand, j/k navigation) on Rich + `readchar` — pure model unit-tested in `tests/test_treeview.py` (no terminal). `run_explore_browser()` renders a version forest (each version expands to size/counts/languages/active+origin detail rows) with key bindings j/k move · space expand · ⏎ details · / filter · a activate(toggle) · d delete(type-name confirm) · p push · r refresh · q quit. `explore` group is now `invoke_without_command=True`; a non-TTY or missing `readchar` falls back to `explore list`. `readchar>=4.0` added to the `[build]` extra (imported lazily so `[dev]`/CI stays green). The `TreeView` is the shared foundation #47's interactive diff reuses. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/46)
- [x] **GH#47** [EXPLORE-G] `explore.py`, `tui.py`, `cli.py` — `qrag explore diff <v1> <v2>`. Fixed in `feat/explore-diff`: `compute_diff()` returns a `DiffResult` — source files added/removed/**changed** (via `file_manifest` sha256, for both code.db and docs.db), symbols added/removed (via the `symbols` table, with `parent_name` pulled from `code_chunks`), and language %% shift. Two modes: `explore diff V1 V2 --json`/`--verbose` emits flat CI output; on a TTY it opens an **interactive `TreeView` diff** — Code as file-tree (`2`) ⇄ AST/parent tree (`1`), Docs as file-tree (`d`), with `/` fuzzy search. Tree builders (`build_file_tree`, `build_symbol_ast_tree`) are pure and unit-tested; keyword-tag diff from the original ticket was dropped with the tag cloud (AD-10). Tests in `tests/test_explore.py` + `tests/test_treeview.py`. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/47)
- [x] **EXPLORE-ZIP** `cli.py`, `zip_distribution.py` — `qrag explore export <version>` and `qrag explore import <file.zip>`: ZIP-based offline sharing. Bundles `code.db`, `docs.db`, `config.json`, `build-report.txt` with a `manifest.json` containing SHA-256 checksums. Import verifies checksums, warns on embedding-model mismatch, and calls `add_active_version()`. Seeds the `explore` Click group ahead of GH#41.
- [x] **AD-17** `mcp_server.py` — Session-scoped database selection: added `list_databases`, `set_active_databases`, `reset_active_databases` MCP tools so the LLM can narrow which globally active DBs are searched per conversation (in-memory, per-process, no session-ID needed under stdio transport) instead of fanning out across the full global `active_versions` set every query. `search_code`/`search_docs`/`get_symbol_definition`/`list_symbols` now return a dict payload with `scope_hint` (server-tracked first-use gating, not LLM-remembered) and `excluded_active_dbs` (LLM-reasoned fallback suggestions, no server-side matching). `SKILL_qrag.md` updated with the checklist workflow. Tests in `tests/test_mcp_server.py`. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` AD-17.
- [x] **GH#48** [EXPLORE-H] `explore.py`, `cli.py` — `qrag explore push <version> --all-remotes`. Fixed in `feat/explore-push-all`: `push_all_remotes()` iterates every configured remote sequentially, skips `can_push=False` backends, and is **continue-on-failure** (a per-remote error is recorded and the loop moves on). The CLI prints a per-remote status line (✓ ok · skipped · ✗ failed · ? dry-run) and, on any failure, lists the exact `qrag explore push <v> --remote <r>` re-run commands and exits 1. Tests in `tests/test_remotes.py`. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/48)

- [x] **GH#26** `cli.py`, `tui.py` — Rich TUI improvements: proportional CPU split (GH#27), MVC extraction to `tui.py`, scrolling log panel, worker-count header, parse `files/s` rate, status line with live error/warning counts, smart path truncation, `fmt_eta` formatter, terminal-too-small fallback, spinners on hub/search commands. Fixed in `feat/gh26-tui-improvements`. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/26)

- [ ] **GH#64** `database.py`, `github_distribution.py`, `cli.py` — Version-controlled database distribution with incremental SQL-row deltas: add a stable `content_hash` column to `code_chunks`/`doc_sections`, generate self-inverting `FORWARD`/`ROLLBACK` `.sql` delta files between revisions, and make `explore push`/`download`/`rollback`/`diff` delta-aware instead of always transferring full databases. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/64)

- [ ] **GH#63** `doc_parser.py`, `pyproject.toml` — Parse Office document formats (`.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.csv`, `.odt`, `.rtf`) alongside existing PDF/HTML support, using pure-Python libraries (`python-docx`, `openpyxl`, `python-pptx`, `striprtf`) with no system-level dependencies. New `doc_type` values feed the existing `search_docs` filter. [GitHub](https://github.com/inegmdev/qrag/issues/63)
